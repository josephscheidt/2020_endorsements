Tracking endorsements in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary

Using the 2020 endorsements data set available from https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/, I'm tracking and exploring the endorsements in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.

Specifically, right now I'm looking at the out-of-state endorsements, attempting to pinpoint when a national groundswell behind a particular candidate begins.
